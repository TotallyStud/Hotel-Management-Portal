1. Running the Project
2. Data Entry
3. Data Backup Process



1 - Running the Project:

This project offers various features accessible through different Python files.
Two options are available for interaction:
Launch the entire project via GUI.py for a comprehensive visual interface with all functionalities.
Execute specific features by running their respective files (e.g., receipt_generator.py) to access individual functionalities based on requirements.



2 - Data Entry Confirmation:

Confirm accuracy during interactions by ensuring the entered details are correct.
After providing information (e.g., customer details, transaction specifics), press the "ok" key to confirm data entry.
This simple step validates the provided information, ensuring accurate processing by the system and maintaining functionality reliability throughout usage.


3 - Data Backup Process:

This project does not provide an automated backup method for records. However, a simple manual process can ensure record backup with ease:

-Locate the "hotel.dat" file:
-Find the "hotel.dat" file in the main folder of the project.
Create a backup copy:
-Copy the "hotel.dat" file to another location while preserving its date and time attributes.
Establish a new folder:
-Create a new folder named "Records" in a suitable location.

Store the backup file:
Paste the copied "hotel.dat" file into the newly created "Records" folder.
This process effectively stores a backup of the records. When you wish to access this record, 
simply replace the current "hotel.dat" file in the main folder with the backup file from the "Records" folder.
Run the program, and the restored record will be available for use.
