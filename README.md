1 - Running the Project 🚀
This project offers various features accessible through different Python files.
Launch the entire project via GUI.py for a comprehensive visual interface with all functionalities.
Execute specific features by running their respective files (e.g., receipt_generator.py) to access individual functionalities based on requirements.


2 - Data Entry Confirmation ✅
Confirm accuracy during interactions by ensuring entered details are correct.
After providing information (e.g., customer details, transaction specifics), press the "ok" key to confirm data entry.
This simple step validates the provided information, ensuring accurate processing by the system and maintaining functionality reliability throughout usage.


3 - Data Backup Process 📂
This project does not provide an automated backup method for records. However, a simple manual process can ensure record backup with ease:
Locate the "hotel.dat" file: Find it in the main folder of the project.
Create a backup copy: Preserve its date and time attributes.
Establish a new folder: Create a "Records" folder.
Store the backup file: Paste the copied "hotel.dat" file into this new folder.
This process effectively stores a backup of the records. Replace the current "hotel.dat" file with the backup from the "Records" folder to access restored records.
